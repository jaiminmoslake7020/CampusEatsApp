                        I want to inform you that whenever
                        you use my Service, in a case of an error in the
                        app I collect data and information (through third
                        party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
                        may include information such as your device Internet
                        Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system
                        version, the configuration of the app when utilizing

                    </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
                        sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
                        are stored on your device's internal memory.
                    </p> <p>
                        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                        However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
                        use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                        services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
                        these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your

                        able to use some portions of this Service.
                    </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                        I may employ third-party companies
                        and individuals due to the following reasons:
                    </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                        I want to inform users of this
                        Service that these third parties have access to your
                        Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                        assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                        not to disclose or use the information for any other
                        purpose.
                    </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                        I value your trust in providing us
                        your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                        commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                        that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                        of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                        I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                        on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
                        Note that these external sites are not operated by
                        me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
                        review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
                        I have no control over and assume no
                        responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
                        practices of any third-party sites or services.

                        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                        I do not knowingly collect personally
                        identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                        I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                        me with personal information,
                        I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
                        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
                        has provided us with personal information, please contact
                        me so that I will be able to do
                        necessary actions.
                    </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
